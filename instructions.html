            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Pong is one of the very first computer games ever made. In this remake, you have the ability to play against an AI or against someone that has access to the same keyboard as you.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="instructions">
            <h1>Instructions</h1>
            <p>Similarly to table tennis, a ball spawns in the center of the game and is hit back and forth by the two players. Points are scored by making the ball pass the other player to where he/she cannot return it. The ball then respawns again, and this process is repeated until one of the players reaches ten points. Whoever reaches ten points first wins.</p>
        </div>

            <h1>Controls</h1>
            <p>This game is operated completely by your keyboard. When making selections on the homescreen, click the key shown in the brackets next to the option on your keyboard. When in a game, player one can move upwar with the "W" key and downwar with the "S" key. Player two can move upwar with the up arrow key and downwar with the down arrow key.</p>
